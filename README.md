## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Tailwind, Catppuccin, Vite

I used Vite to create a React single page application. I made use of React's useContext and useReduce hooks to pass state around between the settings page and the actual task list and links. Tailwind and Catppuccin were used to style the app and provide it with multiple themes for the user to choose from.

## Optimizations

When I return to this project I would like to improve the task list. I think it would be cool to let the user drag and drop tasks to reorder them as well as be able to edit them after they have been entered.

## Lessons Learned:

I used this project as a chance to familiarize myself with tools like Vite and pnpm. They are wonderful tools and I will continue to use them in my personal projects for the foreseeable future.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
